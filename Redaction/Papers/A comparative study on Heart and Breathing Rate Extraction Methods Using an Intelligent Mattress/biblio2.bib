We present a novel algorithm for the detection of individual heart beats and beat-to-beat interval lengths in ballistocardiograms (BCGs) from healthy subjects. An automatic training step based on unsupervised learning techniques is used to extract the shape of a single heart beat from the BCG. Using the learned parameters, the occurrence of individual heart beats in the signal is detected. A final refinement step improves the accuracy of the estimated beat-to-beat interval lengths. Compared to many existing algorithms, the new approach offers heart rate estimates on a beat-to-beat basis. The agreement of the proposed algorithm with an ECG reference has been evaluated. A relative beat-to-beat interval error of 1.79\% with a coverage of 95.94\% was achieved on recordings from 16 subjects.},

Owing to the inherent difficulties in EEG signal processing and neural decoding, many of the feature extraction algorithms are complex and computationally demanding. Presently, software does exist to perform real-time feature extraction and classification of EEG signals. However, the requirement of a personal computer is a major obstacle in bringing these technologies to the home and mobile user affording ease of use. We present the FPGA design and novel architecture of a generalized platform that provides a set of predefined features and preprocessing steps that can be configured by a user for BCI applications. The preprocessing steps include power line noise cancellation and baseline removal while the feature set includes a combination of linear and nonlinear, univariate and bivariate measures commonly utilized in BCIs. We provide a comparison of our results with software and also validate the platform by implementing a seizure detection algorithm on a standard dataset and obtained a classification accuracy of over 96\%. A gradual transition of BCI systems to hardware would prove beneficial in terms of compactness, power consumption and much faster response to stimuli.},

BCG is weak non-stationary random signal and contains a lot of noise caused by the impact of human and equipment. So heart rate detection from the original acquisition BCG is difficult. Through discrete sequence wavelet transform, BCG is preprocessed by translation invariant method based on adaptive threshold wavelet shrinkage. Choosing proper wavelet base and adaptive threshold function, estimating the noise variance are done at the same time. The characteristics of BCG are retained while eliminating noise. Based on de-noised BCG, the heart rate of subject is detected by using pseudo-period detection method. A single channel ECG is recorded synchronously to test the veracity.

The fusion process is performed in the time domain by averaging the readings of the sensors for each sensor array. Subsequently, the CEEMDAN is applied to obtain the interbeat intervals. Experiments are performed with 10 human subjects (males and females) lying on two different positions on a bed for a period of 20 minutes. The overall system performance is assessed against the reference ECG signals. The average and standard deviation of the mean relative absolute error are 0.049, 0.019 and 0.047, 0.038 for fused and best sensors respectively.

Eamax, local maximum energy of BCGy, was quantified for each cardiac cycle. Then a time series of Eamax was created and analyzed using continuous wavelet transform to provide BAMR values. The ECG was used to compute the RSA amplitude as reference. Data were collected on four subjects participating to an imposed controlled breathing protocol with four different breathing sequences. RSA amplitudes and BAMR present significant changes (p {\textless}; 0.05) for low breathing rate (0.10 Hz) compared to high breathing rate (0.25 Hz) and a within-subject correlation was observed. This study suggests that BAMR could be used as a relevant alternative to RSA amplitude for HRV investigation.},

In the field of sleep science, researchers actively study sleep architecture and clinically apply various sleep-related conditions through BCG-derived biological information such as the heartbeat, respiration and body movements of subjects. However, most of these studies have involved only adults. This area of research may be even more important with babies to monitor their biological signals without confinement. For this reason, we developed a physiological signal monitoring bed for baby by using a load cell. Heartbeat and respiration information was assessed with average respective performance errors of 1.53\% and 2.53\% compared to commercial equipment. The results showed the possibility of applying BCG technology to baby. Therefore, we expect that BCG-derived signals can be extensively applied to analyze sleep architecture and clinical applications in baby as they are with adults.},

To assist clinicians in monitoring and diagnosing heart diseases, several electronic devices have been developed. One of the methods, ballistocardiography (BCG) was popular before the 1970s but after that other methods have replaced it, partly because the devices were difficult to construct. Recently developed sensors offer new unobtrusive possibilities to evaluate the condition of the patient's heart even at home without attaching electrodes to the patient. In this study we applied Daubechies compactly supported wavelet transform to extract essential features of the BCG signal and neural networks to classify the BCG. Initial tests with BCG from six subjects indicate that the method can classify the subjects to three classes with a high accuracy. The method is almost insensitive to latency and non-linear disturbance. Moreover, the wavelet transform requires no prior knowledge of the statistical distribution of data samples and the computational complexity and training time are reduced},

The methods we used in this work are new, they are used in image processing, among their applications noise reduction in medical imaging. The use of wavelets has brought a new breath in the field of signal and image processing since its appearance. They make it possible to analyze and identify discontinuities of a signal to one or two dimensions and at different scales. This feature is used for image denoising.

	doi = {10.1109/BHI.2017.7897262},
	abstract = {Unobtrusive and long-term monitoring of human vital signs are essential requirements for early diagnosis and prophylaxis due to many reasons, one of the most important being improving the quality of life. Currently, vital signs are continuously monitored through sensors attached to the body, such as multiple electrodes for measuring electrical activity of the heart. Such methods may be undesirable, especially for elderly, infants and other groups of people. In this paper, we introduce an improved technique for measuring heart rate from noisy ballistocardiogram signals acquired from 50 human volunteers in a sitting position using a massage chair. The signals are unobtrusively collected from a microbend fiber optic sensor embedded within the headrest of the chair, and then transmitted to a computer through a Bluetooth connection. The heart rate is computed using the multiresolution analysis of the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform. The error between the proposed method and the reference ECG is estimated in beats per minute using the mean absolute error, where the system achieved relatively good results (7.31 ± 1.60) despite the large amount of motion artifacts produced owing to the frequent body movements and/or vibrations of the massage chair during stress relief massage. Unlike the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition algorithm, previously employed for heart rate estimation, the suggested system is much faster. Hence, it can be used in real-time applications.},

The NAPS system accurately detected heart rate, averaged over the prescribed 30-s epochs, to within less than 2.72 beats per minute of ECG, and accurately detected breathing rate, averaged over the same epochs, to within 2.10 breaths per minute of RIP bands used in polysomnography.},

The method estimates the quality of the signal waveform by detecting regularly repetitive patterns using proposed spectrum and cepstrum analysis. Multiple window sizes are used to cater for a wide range of target respiratory rates. Furthermore, the readings of multiple sensors are fused to derive a final respiratory rate.

Hence, the sensors made of these materials are useful especially in the measurements of physiological pulsatile signals (e.g., heart rate and respiration). The entire measurement process with the PVDF and EMFi sensors is considered here; from the design and construction of the sensors and measurement electronics to the analysis of the measured data. The paper also presents some examples of the physiological signals (heart rate, respiration, and heart sounds) measured with the PVDF and EMFi sensors. Flexible and thin sensor materials are useful especially in physiological applications where the sensor is integrated into clothing or into daily life objects (e.g., a chair or a bed).

It is not only the spectral parameters per se (amplitude and phase) which are of interest, but there is also a variety of measures derived from them, including important coupling measures like coherence or phase synchrony. After reviewing some of these measures in order to underline the widespread relevance of spectral analysis, this report compares the three classical spectral analysis approaches: Fourier, Hilbert and wavelet transform. Recently, there seems to be increasing acceptance of the notion that Hilbert- or wavelet-based analyses be in some way superior to Fourier-based analyses. The present article counters such views by demonstrating that the three techniques are in fact formally (i.e. mathematically) equivalent when using the class of wavelets that is typically applied in spectral analyses. Moreover, spectral amplitude serves as an example to show that Fourier, Hilbert and wavelet analysis also yield equivalent results in practical applications to neuronal signals.},

In the last years, several research groups have obtained the ballistocardiogram (BCG) by using instrumentation methods simpler than those available in the 1950s and that did not progress because of their complexity as compared to ultrasound and other noninvasive techniques that are in common use nowadays. We describe a novel method for real-time robust heart- (HR) and respiratory- (RR) rate detection from a subject that stands on a common electronic bathroom scale. BCG signals from the scale are wirelessly sent to a PC where algorithms based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) extract the HR and the RR. HR results are compared to those obtained from the ECG. To better assess the RR results, subjects have been asked to synchronize their breathing rate to an on-screen bar-graph set at a constant rate of breaths per minute. This method to obtain the heart and respiratory rates is simple, compact, non-invasive and passive, and can be applied to any person able to stand on an electronic weighing scale, even if wearing shoes.},

A cepstral domain signal analysis technique is proposed to characterize Ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals. With this technique, the average heart beat intervals can be estimated by detecting the dominant peaks in the cepstrum, and the signals of multiple sensors can be fused together to obtain higher signal to noise ratio than each individual sensor. Experiments were conducted with 10 human subjects lying on 2 different postures on a bed. The estimated heart rate from BCG was compared with heart rate ground truth from ECG, and the mean error of estimation obtained is below 1 beat per minute (BPM). The results show that the proposed fusion method can achieve promising heart rate measurement accuracy and robustness against various sensor contact conditions.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a modified technique based on Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) to improve the spectrum estimates of heart rate variability (HRV). In order to make the beat-to-beat (RR) interval be a function of time and produce an evenly sampled time series, we first adopt a preprocessing method to interpolate and resample the original RR interval. Then, the HHT, which is based on the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) approach to decompose the HRV signal into several monocomponent signals that become analytic signals by means of Hilbert transform, is proposed to extract the features of preprocessed time series and to characterize the dynamic behaviors of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system of heart. At last, the frequency behaviors of the Hilbert spectrum and Hilbert marginal spectrum (HMS) are studied to estimate the spectral traits of HRV signals. In this paper, two kinds of experiment data are used to compare our method with the conventional power spectral density (PSD) estimation. The analysis results of the simulated HRV series show that interpolation and resampling are basic requirements for HRV data processing, and HMS is superior to PSD estimation. On the other hand, in order to further prove the superiority of our approach, real HRV signals are collected from seven young health subjects under the condition that autonomic nervous system (ANS) is blocked by certain acute selective blocking drugs: atropine and metoprolol. The high-frequency power/total power ratio and low-frequency power/high-frequency power ratio indicate that compared with the Fourier spectrum based on principal dynamic mode, our method is more sensitive and effective to identify the low-frequency and high-frequency bands of HRV.},

Moreover, the benefit of using multichannel systems as opposed to a single sensor is investigated. While it might seem intuitive that multiple channels are superior to a single channel, the main challenge lies in finding suitable methods to actually leverage this potential. To this end, two algorithms for heart rate estimation from multichannel vibration signals are presented and compared against a single-channel sensing solution. The first method operates by analyzing the cepstrum computed from the average spectra of the individual channels, while the second method applies Bayesian fusion to three interval estimators, such as the autocorrelation, which are applied to each channel. This evaluation is based on 28 night-long sleep lab recordings during which an eight-channel polyvinylidene fluoride-based sensor array was used to acquire cardiac vibration signals. The recruited patients suffered from different sleep disorders of varying severity. From the sensor array data, a virtual single-channel signal was also derived for comparison by averaging the channels. The single-channel results achieved a beat-to-beat interval error of 2.2\% with a coverage (i.e., percentage of the recording which could be analyzed) of 68.7\%. In comparison, the best multichannel results attained a mean error and coverage of 1.0\% and 81.0\%, respectively. These results present statistically significant improvements of both metrics over the single-channel results (p {\textless}; 0.05).},

The working principle behind this sensor is based on the microbending effect of an optical fiber on light transmission. The sensor system comprises of a 1.0-mm-thin graded-index multimode optical fiber-embedded plastic sensor mat, a photoelectronic transceiver, and a computer with a digital signal processing algorithm. In vitro testing showed that our sensor has a typical signal-to-noise ratio better than 28 dB. Clinical MRI trials conducted on 20 healthy human subjects showed good and comparable breathing rate detection (with an accuracy of ±2 bpm) and respiratory-gated image quality produced using the sensor system, with reference to current predicate hospital device/system. The MRI safe, ease of operation characteristics, low fabrication cost, and extra patient comfort offered by this system suggest its good potential in replacing predicate device/system and serve as a dual function in real-time respiratory monitoring and respiratory-gated image acquisition at the same time during MRI.},

The fiber Bragg grating (FBG) is mounted inside a pneumatic cushion to be placed between the backrest of the seat and the back of the monitored person. Deformations of the cushion, involving deformations of the FBG, are proportional to the vibrations of the body leaning on the cushion. Laboratory studies have shown that the sensor allows for obtaining dynamic strains on the sensing FBG in the range of 50-124 μ strain caused by breathing and approximately 8.3 μstrain induced by heartbeat, which are fully measurable by today's FBG interrogation systems. The maximum relative measurement error of the presented sensor is 12\%.

The novelty is in using multichannel algorithms to improve extraction of the heart rate and respiration signal from the recorded ballistocardiographic (BCG) data. Heart rate is extracted by using a sliding Fourier Transform, and after averaging the sensor channels in the frequency domain, the attained resolution enables to detect individual heart beat intervals (HBI) and estimate the heart rate variability (HRV). The respiration signal is calculated from the low pass filtered BCG signals by updating the linear coefficients with an adaptive principal component analysis (PCA) model. In comparison to the reference ECG R-R interval, the relative error of the HBI has been 0.40 \% with 88 \% measurement coverage for the healthy subjects during normal sleep. The error of the respiratory rate estimated from the bed sensor has been 1.5 \% in comparison with the respiratory inductive plethysmogram (RIP). For the group of patients having different kinds of suspected sleep disorders, the measurement coverage varied a lot between subjects due to increased movement artifacts. In this case, some examples of detecting respiratory disorders with bed sensor signals are shown.},

Wavelet Transform (WT) is a better option than Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) for signal extraction and produces higher effective measurement time. In the laboratory, the best results are obtained on the seat. The correlation index was 0.9800 and the Bland-Altman limits of agreement were 0.7136 ± 4.3673 [BPM]. In the hospital waiting room, the best results are also from the seat sensor. The correlation index was 0.9840, and the limits of agreement were 0.4386 ± 3.5884 [BPM].

	abstract = {When recording the pressure oscillations of a seated subject two distinct effects are assessed, ample vibrations due to the person's movement, and periodic oscillations of small amplitude due to cardiopulmonary activity, expressed by the ballistocardiogram (BCG). Embedding a pressure sensor in a chair's back or seat allows unobtrusive monitoring of the BCG. However, inconspicuously acquired signals are affected by numerous artifacts, often generated by the subject's forgetfulness, and posture changes due to lack of constrains. Moreover, the signal changes considerably its shape from person to person, and when the seating posture, or conversely, sensor position, is different. For real-time continuous monitoring, it is still to be found a method which, without introducing significant delays, can deal with such volatility. Thus, tailored calibration of peak detectors and other algorithms is recurrent, and even so, the neighboring samples of artifacts are possibly untreatable. This work evaluates the advantages of Empirical Mode Decomposition, as well as a coarser demodulation approach of the BCG signal, as dependable methods to allow real-time heart rate estimation on unstable BCG records. An analysis of the Fourier transform of the demodulated signals is the method used to provide and compare robustness of heart rate estimates.},

	abstract = {Goal: Our objective is to provide a framework for extracting signals of interest from the wearable seismocardiogram (SCG) measured during walking at normal (subject's preferred pace) and moderately fast (1.34–1.45 m/s) speeds. Methods: We demonstrate, using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and feature tracking algorithms, that the pre-ejection period (PEP) can be accurately estimated from a wearable patch that simultaneously measures electrocardiogram and sternal acceleration signals. We also provide a method to determine the minimum number of heartbeats required for an accurate estimate to be obtained for the PEP from the accelerometer signals during walking. Results: The EMD-based denoising approach provides a statistically significant increase in the signal-to-noise ratio of wearable SCG signals and also improves estimation of PEP during walking. Conclusion: The algorithms described in this paper can be used to provide hemodynamic assessment from wearable SCG during walking. Significance: A major limitation in the use of the SCG, a measure of local chest vibrations caused by cardiac ejection of blood in the vasculature, is that a user must remain completely still for high-quality measurements. The motion can create artifacts and practically render the signal unreadable. Addressing this limitation could allow, for the first time, SCG measurements to be obtained reliably during movement—aside from increasing the coverage throughout the day of cardiovascular monitoring, analyzing SCG signals during movement would quantify the cardiovascular system's response to stress (exercise), and thus provide a more holistic assessment of overall health.},

A simple, robust method is presented for acquiring high-quality, repeatable BCG signals from a modified, commercially available scale. The measured BCG waveforms for all subjects qualitatively matched values in the existing literature and physiologic expectations in terms of timing and IJ amplitude. Additionally, the BCG IJ amplitude was shown to be correlated with diastolic filling time for a subject with premature atrial contractions, demonstrating the sensitivity of the apparatus to beat-by-beat hemodynamic changes. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the BCG was estimated using two methods, and the average SNR over all subjects was greater than 12 for both estimates. The BCG measurement was shown to be repeatable over 50 recordings taken from the same subject over a three week period. This approach could allow patients at home to monitor trends in cardiovascular health.},

First, an artifact detection is an essential preprocessing step to allow a reliable fusion. Second, the robust but computationally efficient median already provides good results; however, using a Bayesian approach, and a short time estimation of the variance, best results in terms of difference to reference heart rate and temporal coverage can be achieved.

	abstract = {In recent years, numerous technological advancements have revived a new interest in the study of Ballistocardiography (BCG). Ballistocardiography has many potential applications in the health field and has recently been integrated into various home health monitoring devices which allow users to consistently track information about their cardiovascular health. Despite these recent advancements, BCG signals are still very susceptible to noise due to the fact that the sensors must be sensitive enough to measure small mechanical movements of the body, unlike electrocardiography signals which are obtained from the body’s electrical activity. This paper focuses on examining two new techniques for processing BCG signals: Singular Spectrum Analysis and Savitzky-Golay filters. Multiple accelerometers are used to simultaneously collect data from varying locations of the body, and the strength of the BCG signal at these locations are independently analyzed. We determine the necessary parameters to enable each method to effectively and successfully remove noise and other artifacts from BCG data. Our results show that SSA is a powerful technique capable of separating the desired BCG signal from the numerous artifacts more effectively than standard techniques. Also, although BCG signals can be detected throughout the body, the sternum and parietal bone tends to contain the most distinguished signals.},

	abstract = {A new method for analysing nonlinear and non-stationary data has been developed. The key part of the method is the ‘empirical mode decomposition’ method with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the ‘instrinic mode functions’ yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy-frequency-time distribution, designated as the Hilbert spectrum. In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ based on local properties of the signal, which make the instantaneous frequency meaningful; and the introduction of the instantaneous frequencies for complicated data sets, which eliminate the need for spurious harmonics to represent nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Examples from the numerical results of the classical nonlinear equation systems and data representing natural phenomena are given to demonstrate the power of this new method. Classical nonlinear system data are especially interesting, for they serve to illustrate the roles played by the nonlinear and non-stationary effects in the energy-frequency-time distribution.},

Moreover, it enables measurements without the presence of medical staff, factor which avoids the stress caused by medical examinations and reduces the patient’s involuntary psychophysiological responses., Given these attributes, and the crescent number of systems developed in recent years, it is therefore pertinent to revise all the information available on the ballistocardiogram’s physiological interpretation, its typical waveform information, its features and distortions, as well as the state of the art in device implementations.},

This is in contrast to most of the existing works in the related signal processing domain, which focus on detecting heart rate only. The system modelling approach may eventually improve the clinical significance of the BCG by extracting deeply embedded information. Towards this goal, here we present our preliminary study where we design a Wavelet-based temporal-frequency system model for associating BCG and ECG. To validate the model, we also collect simultaneous BCG and ECG recordings from 4 healthy subjects. We use the system model to build a BCG to ECG predicting algorithm. We demonstrate that this temporal-frequency model and algorithm is far superior, in terms of accuracy, to the naïve method of linear modelling.},

It can disturb comfortable sleep and, moreover, since it is very expensive experiment, continuous sleep monitoring is difficult. Since heart rate reflects the autonomic nervous system, it is highly synchronized with the sympathetic activation during transition from non-REM sleep to wakefulness. When the transition occurred the heart rate abruptly increased clearly distinguished with other changes. By using this physiology, we tried to classify the wakefulness during the whole night sleep. Our final goal is adopting this method to the continuous monitoring in our daily life. electrocardiogram (ECG) is not the suitable. Subjects have to attach the electrodes by themselves in their housing to obtain ECG. In that point of view, we used the ballistocardiogram (BCG) that is the representative method to obtain heart beat nonintrusively. For ten normal subjects, the wakefulness classifications by using the heart rate dynamics were executed. Nine subjects showed substantial agreement with the visually-scored method, polysomnography (PSG), and only one subject showed moderate agreement in Cohen's kappa value.},
