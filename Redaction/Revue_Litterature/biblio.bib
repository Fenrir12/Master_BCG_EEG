	abstract = {Techniques such as ballistocardiography (BCG) that can provide noninvasive long-term physiological monitoring have gained interest due to a growing recognition of adverse effects from poor sleep and sleep disorders. The noninvasive analysis of physiological signals (NAPS) system is a BCG-based monitoring system developed to measure heart rate, breathing rate, and musculoskeletal movement that shows promise as a general sleep analysis tool. Overnight sleep studies were conducted on 40 healthy subjects during a clinical trial at the University of Virginia. The NAPS system's measures of heart rate and breathing rate were compared to ECG, pulse oximetry, and respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP). The subjects were split into a training dataset and a validation dataset, maintaining similar demographics in each set. The NAPS system accurately detected heart rate, averaged over the prescribed 30-s epochs, to within less than 2.72 beats per minute of ECG, and accurately detected breathing rate, averaged over the same epochs, to within 2.10 breaths per minute of RIP bands used in polysomnography.},

However, using several identical or physically different sensors, redundancy can be used to decrease the error in noncontact heart rate estimation, while increasing the time period during which reliable data are available. In this paper, we show for the first time two major results in case of contactless heart rate measurements deduced from a capacitive ECG and optical pulse signals. First, an artifact detection is an essential preprocessing step to allow a reliable fusion. Second, the robust but computationally efficient median already provides good results; however, using a Bayesian approach, and a short time estimation of the variance, best results in terms of difference to reference heart rate and temporal coverage can be achieved. In this paper, six sensor signals were used and coverage increased from 0-90\% to 80-94\%, while the difference between the estimated heart rate and the gold standard was less than ±2 BPM.},

	abstract = {Unobtrusive and long-term monitoring of human vital signs are essential requirements for early diagnosis and prophylaxis due to many reasons, one of the most important being improving the quality of life. Currently, vital signs are continuously monitored through sensors attached to the body, such as multiple electrodes for measuring electrical activity of the heart. Such methods may be undesirable, especially for elderly, infants and other groups of people. In this paper, we introduce an improved technique for measuring heart rate from noisy ballistocardiogram signals acquired from 50 human volunteers in a sitting position using a massage chair. The signals are unobtrusively collected from a microbend fiber optic sensor embedded within the headrest of the chair, and then transmitted to a computer through a Bluetooth connection. The heart rate is computed using the multiresolution analysis of the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform. The error between the proposed method and the reference ECG is estimated in beats per minute using the mean absolute error, where the system achieved relatively good results (7.31 ± 1.60) despite the large amount of motion artifacts produced owing to the frequent body movements and/or vibrations of the massage chair during stress relief massage. Unlike the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition algorithm, previously employed for heart rate estimation, the suggested system is much faster. Hence, it can be used in real-time applications.},

	abstract = {In recent years, numerous technological advancements have revived a new interest in the study of Ballistocardiography (BCG). Ballistocardiography has many potential applications in the health field and has recently been integrated into various home health monitoring devices which allow users to consistently track information about their cardiovascular health. Despite these recent advancements, BCG signals are still very susceptible to noise due to the fact that the sensors must be sensitive enough to measure small mechanical movements of the body, unlike electrocardiography signals which are obtained from the body’s electrical activity. This paper focuses on examining two new techniques for processing BCG signals: Singular Spectrum Analysis and Savitzky-Golay filters. Multiple accelerometers are used to simultaneously collect data from varying locations of the body, and the strength of the BCG signal at these locations are independently analyzed. We determine the necessary parameters to enable each method to effectively and successfully remove noise and other artifacts from BCG data. Our results show that SSA is a powerful technique capable of separating the desired BCG signal from the numerous artifacts more effectively than standard techniques. Also, although BCG signals can be detected throughout the body, the sternum and parietal bone tends to contain the most distinguished signals.},

To assist clinicians in monitoring and diagnosing heart diseases, several electronic devices have been developed. One of the methods, ballistocardiography (BCG) was popular before the 1970s but after that other methods have replaced it, partly because the devices were difficult to construct. Recently developed sensors offer new unobtrusive possibilities to evaluate the condition of the patient's heart even at home without attaching electrodes to the patient. In this study we applied Daubechies compactly supported wavelet transform to extract essential features of the BCG signal and neural networks to classify the BCG. Initial tests with BCG from six subjects indicate that the method can classify the subjects to three classes with a high accuracy. The method is almost insensitive to latency and non-linear disturbance. Moreover, the wavelet transform requires no prior knowledge of the statistical distribution of data samples and the computational complexity and training time are reduced},

Moreover, it enables measurements without the presence of medical staff, factor which avoids the stress caused by medical examinations and reduces the patient’s involuntary psychophysiological responses., Given these attributes, and the crescent number of systems developed in recent years, it is therefore pertinent to revise all the information available on the ballistocardiogram’s physiological interpretation, its typical waveform information, its features and distortions, as well as the state of the art in device implementations.},

The working principle behind this sensor is based on the microbending effect of an optical fiber on light transmission. The sensor system comprises of a 1.0-mm-thin graded-index multimode optical fiber-embedded plastic sensor mat, a photoelectronic transceiver, and a computer with a digital signal processing algorithm. In vitro testing showed that our sensor has a typical signal-to-noise ratio better than 28 dB. Clinical MRI trials conducted on 20 healthy human subjects showed good and comparable breathing rate detection (with an accuracy of ±2 bpm) and respiratory-gated image quality produced using the sensor system, with reference to current predicate hospital device/system. The MRI safe, ease of operation characteristics, low fabrication cost, and extra patient comfort offered by this system suggest its good potential in replacing predicate device/system and serve as a dual function in real-time respiratory monitoring and respiratory-gated image acquisition at the same time during MRI.},

When the transition occurred the heart rate abruptly increased clearly distinguished with other changes. By using this physiology, we tried to classify the wakefulness during the whole night sleep. Our final goal is adopting this method to the continuous monitoring in our daily life. electrocardiogram (ECG) is not the suitable. Subjects have to attach the electrodes by themselves in their housing to obtain ECG. In that point of view, we used the ballistocardiogram (BCG) that is the representative method to obtain heart beat nonintrusively.

Recently, there seems to be increasing acceptance of the notion that Hilbert- or wavelet-based analyses be in some way superior to Fourier-based analyses. The present article counters such views by demonstrating that the three techniques are in fact formally (i.e. mathematically) equivalent when using the class of wavelets that is typically applied in spectral analyses. Moreover, spectral amplitude serves as an example to show that Fourier, Hilbert and wavelet analysis also yield equivalent results in practical applications to neuronal signals.},

	abstract = {This paper shows the design of a fiber-based sensor for living activities in human body and the results of a laboratory evaluation carried out on it. The authors have developed a device that allows for monitoring the vibrations of human body evoked by living activities-breathing and cardiac rhythm. The device consists of a Bragg grating inscribed into a single mode optical fiber and operating on a wavelength of around 1550 nm. The fiber Bragg grating (FBG) is mounted inside a pneumatic cushion to be placed between the backrest of the seat and the back of the monitored person. Deformations of the cushion, involving deformations of the FBG, are proportional to the vibrations of the body leaning on the cushion. Laboratory studies have shown that the sensor allows for obtaining dynamic strains on the sensing FBG in the range of 50-124 μ strain caused by breathing and approximately 8.3 μstrain induced by heartbeat, which are fully measurable by today's FBG interrogation systems. The maximum relative measurement error of the presented sensor is 12\%. The sensor's simple design enables it to be easily implemented in pilot's and driver's seats for monitoring the physiological condition of pilots and drivers.},

	abstract = {The ballistocardiogram (BCG) measures the reaction of the body to cardiac ejection forces, and is an effective, non-invasive means of evaluating cardiovascular function. A simple, robust method is presented for acquiring high-quality, repeatable BCG signals from a modified, commercially available scale. The measured BCG waveforms for all subjects qualitatively matched values in the existing literature and physiologic expectations in terms of timing and IJ amplitude. Additionally, the BCG IJ amplitude was shown to be correlated with diastolic filling time for a subject with premature atrial contractions, demonstrating the sensitivity of the apparatus to beat-by-beat hemodynamic changes. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the BCG was estimated using two methods, and the average SNR over all subjects was greater than 12 for both estimates. The BCG measurement was shown to be repeatable over 50 recordings taken from the same subject over a three week period. This approach could allow patients at home to monitor trends in cardiovascular health.},
